--Resetting auto increment
SET @num := 0;
UPDATE my_table SET id =@num : (@num + 1);
ALTER TABLE my_table AUTO_INCREMENT = 1;

--Example
SET @num := 0;
UPDATE program SET program_id = @num := (@num + 1);
ALTER TABLE program AUTO_INCREMENT =1;

--To help delete items from sql
DELETE FROM actors
WHERE first_name = 'Tom';

DELETE FROM table_name;
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;

AUTO_INCREMENT = automatically generates a unique numeric value wherever it is placed.
Example = program_id, is automatically generated, so you do not have to manually number
each program. When a new program is added, it will automatically give the new program
an id. 

enum = a string data type that allows you to define a column with a predefined set of values.
For example, if you define a column as ENUM('small', 'medium', 'large'), only these three values can be stored. 
Any attempt to insert a value outside this list will result in an error. 

varchar = A variable-length string that can store any text up to the defined maximum length.
Example, VARCHAR(20)... It allows complete flexibility—any string can be stored as long as it meets the length constraint.

blob = (Binary Large Object) is a data type in MySQL that allows you to store large binary data such as images, audio, video, and other multimedia files. 

In this project, I used varchar instead of blob because I stored as a file path/url. When I changed it from BLOB to varchar, all of my images showed up on my display.
